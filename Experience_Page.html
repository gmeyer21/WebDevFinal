<p class="ptitle">Help Desk Intern,</p>
<p class="ptitle2">Lourdes University - Sylvania, OH</p>
<p class="pe">I had landed my first IT job as a help desk intern at my institution. This break into IT has provided me with a fundamental foundation for my continued venture in IT. It has taught me everything from customer support to how each part of a computer works. I first started learning troubleshooting here as well.
	With a well structured environment and team, I had felt as if it was the perfect fit for me, for the start. And, with enough experience, I was able to even start training new interns.
	They say breaking into IT is the hardest part of IT, and I am forever grateful for such an opportunity, as this team was always more than happy to lend a helping hand and teach me.
	I always asked questions here, as I thought I knew IT, but it was just the start.</p>

<p class="ptitle">IT Security Intern,</p>
<p class="ptitle2">Belle Tire - Allen Park, MI</p>
<p class="pe">	My first Summer internship was at the corporate headquarters of Belle Tire near Detroit, Michigan. I remember the interview was intense, as they had brought the full IT team on for my interview, (bandwidth was definitely an issue here).
	I was able to make amazing connections and friendships that continued outside of work as well. This was also my first look at a hybrid schedule. In this hybrid schedule I could stay home 2-3 days a week and go to the office the other days.
I had two main mentors during this time. Both of whom would help me with my final project for the team. One was a network engineer, and the other, the IT director. They helped me outline security between 3rd party applications and partners that the company uses.
	I also had the opportunity to meet the other interns, go on trips to stores across Michigan, a Kalamazoo trip, and a Tigers game! They also sponsored my trip to Grrcon (a hacking convention) 2 months after I had left!
	In the end, I presented the final project to the CEO and board of directors. The goodbyes were tough, as it had been one of the best Summers I could have asked for.</p>

    <p class="ptitle">IT Technician</p>
<p class="ptitle2">Creadio/Tolhouse - Toledo, OH</p>
<p class="pe">	My current job, where I have gained experience in networking the most, by far. Being solely responsible for network operations, topology, AP’s, and more. These were big shoes to step in! I am the only IT person for the company, so everything IT has gotten delegated to me.
	Learning new software on the fly, and really stepping out of my comfort zone to learn more to perform work that needed to be done.
	This social club has a coffeehouse as well, so it makes a great fit as I love coffee. My supervisor (Owner/CEO), has been exceptional in providing me the time and motivation to step into this role.
	One of my favorite parts of this role is my current sprint of installing and configuring digital signage players to broadcast messages to local schools. Kids are always so curious and  excited to see the TV’s in their school start to play videos. (I am often called the TV guy by them).</p>
